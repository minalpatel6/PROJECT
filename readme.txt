The following notes are key in terms of being able to compile the program correctly.




1.  The IDE - I have implemented Visual Studio Express 2010 IDE on Windows 7 with 64 GB.  However, the project that I have built can run on Windows 8 machines.So please ensure that Visual Studio  IDE must be 2010 or higher.  



2.  How to access the .exe file:  Navigate to the folder that reads "\PROJECT\MINAL_biometrix_1202572\MINAL_biometrix_1202572\bin\Debug"

here you will find "MINAL_biometrix_1202572" Application file.

3. Make sure "MINAL_biometrix_1202572.sql" sql database to import in the database.
